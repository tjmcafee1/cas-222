            <h2>ABOUT THE EVENT</h2>
            <p>The Annual Ace in the Hole MultiSport Weekend is a legendary event in the Oregon
                triathlon and running community. It has become a traditional destination race
                for athletes from across the nation. There is something for every level of athletic
                ability. The weekend includes a first timer triathlon, a sprint, Olympic, and Half-Iron
                triathlons and 10K and Half marathon runs. Come to experience your first race or come
                to compete to win, but make sure you come to have fun!</p>
            </div>

            <h3>What to Bring</h3>
            <p>Watch the weather closely. The show goes on no matter what the weather is doing.
                You must wear your chip timing piece during the entire event. You will be given a band
                that will hold your chip timing piece around your ankle throughout the entire event.
                Be sure that it is snapped tightly. Be sure to have your Chip Timing piece on before you
                start the race and be sure to step over the timing mats after each segment of the race.
                If you are wearing a wet-suit, make sure the timing piece goes under your wetsuit
                otherwise, you will have a very difficult time getting off your wet suit.</p>

                <dt class="dtpadding">Swim</dt>
                    <dd>Wetsuits are optional for the swim but will provide buoyancy and warmth.
                        However, many people opt for no wetsuit for a triathlon so no worries. We will
                        provide you with a swim cap but you will want to bring your own goggles.</dd>
                <dt class="dtpadding">Bike</dt>
                    <dd>A biking helmet is mandatory. You will also receive 2 stickers in your package
                        with your race number on them. The small sticker should go on the front of your
                        helmet. The bigger sticker will wrap around your bike frame. Road or mountain bikes
                        are acceptable. For safety reasons, be sure to have end-caps on the end of your
                        handle-bars.</dd>
                <dt class="dtpadding">Run</dt>
                    <dd>You must finish the race with your bib number on the front of you. Some people
                        choose to pin it on at the beginning of the race and have it on for the whole event
                        so they don’t have to worry about it. Others pin it on a singlet that they put on
                        once they finish the swim before they head out for the bike. Others use an elastic
                        racing strap that they pin their bib number to and then quickly strap it on before
                        they leave for the run. Use whatever option feels best for you.</dd>

                        miles and it's a 2 loop course making it very spectator friendly!) and a flat 2 mile

            <h2>FAQs</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt class="dtpadding">What are the Rules?</dt>
                    <dd>We currently adhere to the USAT Rules for Triathlon & Duathlon. Important
                        rules include no drafting, you must wear a helmet and music is ABSOLUTELY
                        NOT allowed during the bike for obvious safety reasons.</dd>

                <dt class="dtpadding">Can I use a personal music device while cycling?</dt>
                    <dd>Absolutely no music devices are allowed during the bike segment for
                        obvious safety risks and will result in immediate disqualification.</dd>

                <dt class="dtpadding">Can I use a personal music device while running?</dt>
                    <dd>During any running segments, we prefer for athletes to NOT use music
                        devices to maximize safety, assure a fair competitive environment and assure
                        athletes can hear all course marshal instructions. With that said, we also
                        understand that many athletes rely on music to help endure the challenge of
                        running. To accommodate the needs of our athletes while still assuring maximum
                        safety and a fair, competitive environment, here is the arrangement that we
                        can accommodate. If you chose to use a personal music device, you must always
                        keep one ear open for instructions so only one ear-bud can be used at any time.
                        In addition, if you opt to use music, you will not be eligible for awards,
                        points and rankings. So as an athlete, you have to make a choice…music or
                        awards/points/rankings. If you are using a personal music devise with two
                        earbuds, you will be immediately disqualified. Trust us, we don’t want to have
                        to enforce a disqualification but in order to assure the safety of all athletes,
                        this is a very important rule. We also request that if you chose to use a
                        personal music device that you keep the volume to a minimum to assure all
                        instructions can be heard.</dd>

                <dt class="dtpadding">Do I need to wear a wetsuit?</dt>
                    <dd>No, you do not need to wear a wetsuit. Many will not wear a wetsuit while
                        others will choose to wear a wetsuit because of the buoyancy and warmth
                        factor.</dd>

                <dt class="dtpadding">Do I have to use a road or racing bike?</dt>
                    <dd>No. We welcome any type of bike as long as it is functioning properly with
                        brakes and endcaps at the end of your handlebars.</dd>
