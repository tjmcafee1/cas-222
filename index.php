                <h4>Long Course RUN – 13.1mi </h4>- A mostly flat loop course on widely paved bike paths that traverse through and around this beautiful and scenic destination resort (two hills total with a minimal elevation gain).

                <h4>10k COURSE: </h4>The 10K event starts and finishes in the Athletes Village. The paths are approximately 6 ft wide, perfectly paved and wind around through the forest. Each course has only two small hills with a minimal elevation gain to navigate and a fast downhill to flat finish to the roaring cheers of the crowd.
